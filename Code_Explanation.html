This script uses the requests library to make a GET request to the Facebook Graph API and retrieve the video's source URL. Then it uses requests.get() to download the video and saves it in the local directory with the name 'video.mp4'.

You need to replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with your Facebook access token and VIDEO_ID with the actual video id that you want to download.

Please note that this script is for educational purposes only and should not be used to download videos without the owner's permission. Also, please make sure to follow Facebook's guidelines and terms of service while using the API.
